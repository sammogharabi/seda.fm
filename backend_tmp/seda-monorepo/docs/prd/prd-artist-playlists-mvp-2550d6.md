# **📀 PRD: Artist Playlists (MVP – External Sharing + Voting)**

**Last updated: 2025-08-28**

---

## **Objective**

Enable artists to **share their Spotify/Apple playlists directly inside Seda** as part of their profiles and in rooms/chat, where fans can discover, vote, and engage with them. This is a lightweight MVP that defers native Seda playlist creation to Post-MVP.

---

## **Scope (MVP)**

- **External Playlist Sharing:**
  - Artist connects Spotify/Apple account (OAuth).
  - Playlists can be posted into Seda rooms/chat.
  - Playlists display as **cards** with artwork, provider badge, and “Open in Spotify/Apple” link.
- **Voting Integration:**
  - Fans can vote 👍/👎 on shared artist playlists.
  - Votes count toward DJ Points and leaderboards.
- **Profiles:**
  - Artist playlists shared appear in a **“Playlists” section** on their profile.
- **Discovery:**
  - Playlists surface in rooms, profiles, and chat as shareable, votable content.
---

## **Post-MVP Enhancements**

- **Native Seda Playlists:** Artists create/edit playlists of Seda-hosted tracks.
- **Collaboration:** Artists and fans co-curate playlists.
- **Playlist Leaderboards:** Global/genre-based top playlists by votes.
- **Auto-Match:** Convert Spotify/Apple playlists to Seda-native versions when tracks exist in Seda’s catalog.
---

## **User Stories**

- **As an artist,** I can connect my Spotify/Apple to Seda to share playlists.
- **As a fan,** I can view and vote on an artist’s shared playlist.
- **As an artist,** I can showcase my playlists on my Seda profile.
---

## **Acceptance Criteria**

- Shared playlists render as cards in rooms/chat.
- Cards include cover art, provider badge, votes, and “Open in Spotify/Apple.”
- Voting is real-time and tied to DJ Points.
- Artist profile displays a list of shared playlists with vote counts.
