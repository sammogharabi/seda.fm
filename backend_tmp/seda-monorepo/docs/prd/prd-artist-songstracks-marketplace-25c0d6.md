# **PRD – Artist Songs/Tracks Marketplace**

## **1. Objective**

Allow artists to **sell tracks directly to fans** through their seda profiles. Fans can purchase, download, and own music in multiple formats (e.g., MP3, HD).

Ensure a **lightweight but effective anti-piracy approach** that balances protection with ease of use.

## **2. Scope**

### **MVP**

- **Upload & Sale:** Artists upload tracks, set prices, and sell directly.
- **Formats:** Fans can download in common formats (MP3, HD/FLAC).
- **Ownership Confirmation:** Artists must confirm they legally own the rights. If not, seda provides a link to the official copyright registration site.
- **Transactions:** 100% revenue pass-through to artists, minus unavoidable transaction fees.
- **DRM/Anti-Piracy:**
  - Invisible watermark embedded in purchased files (buyer ID/transaction ID).
  - Secure download links that expire after 3–5 uses.
### **Post-MVP**

- **In-app Publishing:** Artists can publish/copyright songs directly inside seda (no external government site needed).
- **Advanced DRM:** Optional seda-only playback mode for premium or unreleased tracks.
- **Bundles:** Sell EPs/albums as multi-track purchases.
- **Gifting:** Fans can gift tracks to other seda members.

## **3. Target Customers**

- **Independent Artists/DJs** – monetize tracks directly, without relying only on streaming.
- **Fans** – support artists by purchasing exclusive, high-quality music.
---

## **4. UX Notes**

- **Track Cards:** Show title, price, format options.
- **Purchase Modal:** Payment → confirmation → download link.
- **Copyright Warning:** Simple checkbox flow: *“I own the rights to this track. If not, click here to register your work.”*

## **5. Success Metrics**

- % of artists uploading tracks for sale.
- Average revenue per artist from track sales.
- Total GMV (gross merchandise volume) of music purchases.
