# **📄 PRD – Artist Merch Marketplace**

## **1. Objective**

Allow artists to **monetize their fanbase by showcasing merch** directly on their seda profiles.

Fans can click through to purchase via external shops for MVP, with a path to full seda-native storefronts later.

---

## **2. Scope**

### **MVP**

- **Merch Links:** Artists can add unlimited external links to merch sites (Shopify, Bandcamp, Printful, Etsy, etc.).
- **Display:** Links appear as branded cards under the “Merch” section of the artist’s profile.
- **Flexibility:** Each link can include title, short description, and thumbnail image.
### **Post-MVP**

- **Native Storefront:** Artists can build and host a merch shop directly inside seda.
- **Checkout Integration:** Cart + payment flows (Stripe, PayPal, Apple Pay, Google Pay).
- **Fulfillment Integration:** APIs for Shopify, Printful, etc.
- **Analytics:** Impressions, clicks, conversions (surfaced in an Artist Analytics Dashboard).
---

## **3. Target Customers**

- **Artists:** Increase merch sales by surfacing links in a trusted context.
- **Fans:** Discover artist merch without leaving seda.
---

## **4. UX Notes**

- Merch links displayed as **visual cards** (cover image + title + CTA button).
- Links open in a **new tab** to avoid disrupting seda session.
---

## **5. Success Metrics**

- % of artist profiles with merch links.
- CTR (click-through rate) on merch links.
- Conversion rate (tracked post-MVP when analytics dashboard is built).
