# **📄 PRD – Artist Marketplace (High-Level)**

## **1. Objective**

Create a **centralized marketplace on artist profiles** where fans can directly support artists by purchasing their **merch, concert tickets, and tracks**.

This marketplace will drive artist revenue, deepen fan engagement, and consolidate all commercial activity into a single, trusted destination within seda.

---

## **2. Scope**

### **MVP**

- **Merch:** Artists can add external links to their merch shops (Shopify, Bandcamp, etc.).
- **Concerts:** Artists can add external links to ticket sites (Bandsintown, Ticketmaster, Eventbrite, etc.).
- **Songs/Tracks:** Artists can upload and sell tracks directly on seda. Fans purchase and download in multiple formats (MP3, HD).
  - Artists must confirm copyright ownership before publishing.
  - 100% revenue pass-through to artists (minus unavoidable transaction fees).
  - **DRM/Anti-Piracy:** Invisible watermarking of purchased files + secure download links (3–5 max uses).
### **Post-MVP**

- **Merch:** Build native merch storefronts within seda (cart, checkout, fulfillment integrations).
- **Concerts:** Auto-surface upcoming tour dates near a user’s location, with in-platform ticket purchase flows.
- **Songs/Tracks:** Allow artists to publish/copyright directly in seda. Explore seda-only playback mode for premium content.
---

## **3. Target Customers**

- **Independent Artists/DJs** – looking for direct-to-fan monetization channels.
- **Fans** – want one-stop access to merch, shows, and exclusive tracks.
- **Emerging Labels (future)** – may leverage seda marketplace to push artists’ offerings in a unified way.
---

## **4. Underserved Needs**

- **Fragmented fan journey:** Today, fans jump across platforms (Spotify for music, Shopify for merch, Ticketmaster for shows).
- **Low trust in independent sales:** Many fans hesitate to buy direct unless it’s aggregated in a trusted platform.
- **Limited artist monetization options:** Streaming provides minimal revenue; seda gives artists new ways to monetize.
---

## **5. Value Proposition**

- **For Artists:** A unified profile to sell across merch, shows, and music.
- **For Fans:** A single place to support artists they love.
- **For seda:** A differentiated marketplace that blends community, music discovery, and commerce.
---

## **6. User Experience (UX) Overview**

- **Artist Profile Marketplace Tab:** Displays three sections: *Merch, Concerts, Tracks*.
- **Merch Section:** List of clickable merch links (opens in external site for MVP).
- **Concerts Section:** List of linked shows (opens ticketing site for MVP).
- **Tracks Section:** Purchase/download buttons for songs (MP3 + HD formats, with DRM safeguards).
---

## **7. Nested PRDs (Sub-Pages)**

---

## **8. Success Metrics**

- % of artist profiles with active marketplace items.
- Number of purchases (songs/merch/tickets) per fan session.
- GMV (Gross Merchandise Volume) through seda.
- Repeat purchase rate from fans.
