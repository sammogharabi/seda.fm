# **📄 PRD – Artist Concerts Marketplace**

## **1. Objective**

Allow artists to **promote and sell tickets to their shows** directly from seda profiles.

Fans can easily find upcoming events and purchase tickets from external providers in MVP, with a future path to localized tour surfacing and native ticketing.

---

## **2. Scope**

### **MVP**

- **Concert Links:** Artists can add links to external ticketing pages (Bandsintown, Ticketmaster, Eventbrite, etc.).
- **Display:** Concerts displayed as cards with event name, date, city, and link to ticket page.
- **Flexibility:** Unlimited concerts can be added per artist.
### **Post-MVP**

- **Location-Based Surfacing:** Auto-detect user’s location and surface nearby tour dates from artist feeds.
- **Native Ticket Flow:** Purchase directly within seda (API integrations with ticketing providers).
- **Fan Notifications:** Alert fans when an artist they follow has a show nearby.
- **Analytics:** Clicks + ticket sales performance (via Artist Analytics Dashboard).
---

## **3. Target Customers**

- **Artists:** Increase concert attendance by promoting shows natively.
- **Fans:** Convenient discovery of upcoming shows, starting from the artist profile.
---

## **4. UX Notes**

- Concert cards include:
  - Title (e.g., *Live at The Echo*)
  - Date + City
  - “Get Tickets” CTA (external link for MVP).
- Post-MVP: auto-generate cards from APIs (Bandsintown, Ticketmaster).
---

## **5. Success Metrics**

- % of artist profiles with at least one concert listed.
- CTR on concert links.
- Ticket purchases (trackable post-MVP).
