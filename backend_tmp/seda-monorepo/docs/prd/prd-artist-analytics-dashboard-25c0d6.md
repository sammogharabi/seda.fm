# **PRD – Artist Analytics Dashboard**

## **1. Objective**

Provide artists with a **centralized dashboard** to track engagement and revenue from their seda marketplace activities (merch, concerts, and tracks).

This builds trust with artists by giving them transparency, and helps them optimize how they monetize their fans.
